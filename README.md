# Analysis
All data from BellaBeat was handled inside of Excel.

We can see a discrepency between Registered Activity logs and Sleep logs. A suggestion might be to predict what time a user goes to sleep and send a reminder to their device to log their sleep activity. A good prediction for this might be 9-11pm, as this is when "Steps by hour" activity dies down.

Additionally, we can see a "Steps by hour" peak at 9-10 am and 6-7pm. There is a slight dip in steps between those times. Another reminder to get active around 3pm might help users increase step count. This will in turn help lower Sedentary time. 

A rewards system or leaderboard might help increase fairly/very active amounts. More time spent active awards users points, which can be displayed on a leaderboard or used to collect rewards from BellaBeat.
